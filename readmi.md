The data directory contains the preprocessed data that you'll use to train and test your model. The model.py file contains the Python code for building, training, and testing the deep learning model. The omnetpp directory contains the OMNeT++ simulation files, including the omnetpp.ini configuration file and the simulation.ned network topology file.
	
	
# X_train.npy
This will save the X_train array as a .npy file in the current directory. You can then load the array later using numpy.load() function.


# Y_train.npy
This will save the y_train array as a .npy file in the current directory. You can then load the array later using numpy.load() function.

# X_test.npy
This will save the X_test array as a .npy file in the current directory. You can then load the array later using numpy.load() function.

# Y_test.npy
This will save the y_test array as a .npy file in the current directory. You can then load the array later using numpy.load() function.

# model.py
This code defines a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with three convolutional layers, max pooling, dropout, and a dense output layer with sigmoid activation. It then compiles the model with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, and trains it on the preprocessed data. Finally, it evaluates the model on the test data and prints the test loss and accuracy.
Note that you may need to adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters to optimize performance on your specific task.

# omnetpp.ini
This configuration file specifies the network topology and application parameters for the simulation. In particular, it sets the number of applications per node to 1 and specifies the type of application (DdosDetectionApp), the routing table file, the classifier file, and the features file for each node. It also sets the attack rate and packet size for the application and specifies the mobility model for the nodes.

Note that you may need to modify this configuration file depending on your specific needs, including the values of the various parameters and the file names for your model and data.

# simulation.ned
This code defines a network topology with a configurable number of nodes (n) connected by ideal radio channels with a small delay. Each node is an instance of the Node module, which can be further defined to include any necessary components such as a DDoS detection application. The Ipv4NetworkConfigurator module assigns unique IP addresses to each node, while the IntegratedVisualizer module provides a visualization of the network topology during simulation.
Note that you may need to modify this network topology file depending on your specific needs, including the number of nodes and any additional components required for your simulation.
